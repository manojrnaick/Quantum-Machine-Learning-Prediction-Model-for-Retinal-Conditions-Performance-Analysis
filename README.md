# Quantum-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Model-for-Retinal-Conditions-Performance-Analysis

Quantum machine learning predictive models are emerging and in this study we developed a classifier to infer the ophthalmic disease from OCT images. We used OCT images of the retina in  vision threatening conditions such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular edema (DME) and Drusen. PennyLane.ai an open-source software tool based on the concept of quantum differentiable programming was used mainly to train the quantum circuits. The training was tested on an IBM 5 qubits System “ibmq_belem” and 32 qubits simulator “ibmq_qasm_simulator”. The results are promising.
